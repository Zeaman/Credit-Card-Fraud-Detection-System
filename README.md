# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-System
A 'credit card fraud detection system' has been developed and trained using machine learning techniques, achieving a high training accuracy of 95.04%. The system employs an improved algorithm that leverages the famous machine learning strategy called Logistic Regression to enhance sensitivity in fraud detection. Additionally, deep learning approaches, particularly deep artificial neural networks (DANN), have been applied to strengthen the system's capability to identify credit card financial fraud.
The model uses a machine learning-based approach for credit card fraud detection, achieving an outstanding accuracy of 93.49% when tested. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the system in accurately distinguishing fraudulent transactions.
To implement this fraud detection system, a LR-algorithm approach has been utilized, employing classification algorithms to ensure robust detection of credit card fraud. The use of RL adds efficiency to the machine learning models, contributing to the overall effectiveness of the system and training the model.
The trained Credit Card Fraud Detection System has been saved as a joblib file, providing a convenient and efficient way to deploy the model for real-time fraud detection scenarios.
